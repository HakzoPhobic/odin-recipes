# Odin Recipes Project

This is a simple web project created as part of The Odin Project's foundations course. The site consists of a main page that links to multiple recipe pages, each containing details like ingredients, instructions, and images.

The project is built using HTML only, with a focus on structuring content properly. It serves as an introduction to working with basic web development concepts.
